# Maastricht University | Course: Databases
This repository contains a MySql database for fictional Pizza delivery. As a framework, Django was used using a Model-View-Controller architecture (MVC). Over the terminal, the user can order pizzas and input his address, where the data is stored in the database. This project was created as LAB for the Database course at Maastricht University.
